You are a staff engineer. I want to implement 2 new pages.

The first is a simple landing page that acts as the entry point to the website. It should show the app name, and the page should consist of tiles displaying the key features of the app. There should be a Get Started button.

The second is a simple login page. Clicking Get Started should take them to this page. I'd like to implement a simple username and password login. Sign in with google should also be an option. Then, after logging in, the user should be able to go to his main page of the app, loading in all his previous reflects and study notes.

Please review these new features, review the entire codebase, review the privacy and personalization features implemented, and create a design and implementation plan that a junior engineer can follow to execute this efficiently and effectively. Clean up any errors that may come up along the way

When creating this plan, please consider the following:

- The login/signup should keep the privacy and personalization features in mind.
- The main page should load the user's data efficiently and effectively.
- The login page should be secure and easy to use.
- The main page should be easy to navigate and use.

On the user's first time logging into the app, I'd like a popup to appear asking them about their personalization preferences. They should be able to choose to opt out of this. If they choose to opt in, the app should ask them to choose which data types they would like to personalize. They should be able to select which specific data points they would like to personalize. It should make them click a checkbox stating that they understand the privacy implications of their choices. Display the privacy policy on this last page of the popup. Save their preferences in User settings, and allow them to change their preferences later. Ensure that the user's preferences are used throughout the app as specified in implementation_guide.md and privacy_policy.md.
