You are a staff engineer. I want to implement 2 new pages.

The first is a simple landing page that acts as the entry point to the website. It should show the app name, and the page should consist of tiles displaying the key features of the app. There should be a Get Started button.

The second is a simple login page. Clicking Get Started should take them to this page. I'd like to implement a simple username and password login. Sign in with google should also be an option. Then, after logging in, the user should be able to go to his main page of the app, loading in all his previous reflects and study notes.

Please review these new features, review the entire codebase, review the privacy and personalization features implemented, and create a design and implementation plan that a junior engineer can follow to execute this efficiently and effectively. Clean up any errors that may come up along the way
