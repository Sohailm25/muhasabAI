# Implementation Guide: Identity-to-Action Framework Page

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation specifications for an "Identity Builder" feature within the existing application. This feature will guide users through a structured framework to transform spiritual aspirations into actionable systems, habits, and triggers. The implementation combines a visual dashboard with an AI-guided sequential process that helps users develop comprehensive identity frameworks.

## User Experience Overview

### Primary User Flows

1. **Dashboard View**: Users can view all their existing identity frameworks in a consolidated dashboard.
2. **Framework Creation**: Users can initiate a new identity framework through a guided, sequential process.
3. **Framework Management**: Users can edit, expand, or remove elements from existing frameworks.

## Detailed Implementation Specifications

### 1. Dashboard Layout

**Components:**
- Header section with page title and "Create New Framework" button
- Grid or list view of existing identity frameworks
- Empty state for first-time users with educational content

**Technical Requirements:**
- Responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- Card components for each existing framework
- Data retrieval API integration to load saved frameworks
