# Sahab AI - Application Description

## Overview
Sahab AI is a Mobile/Web Application designed to bring the benefits of large language models (LLMs) to the Muslim community in an authentic and beneficial way. It serves Muslim individuals seeking spiritual growth, reflection, goal-setting, and personal development by providing an AI-powered companion that respects Islamic traditions while helping users deepen their faith practice through reflection and actionable insights.

## Key Features and Functionality

* **HalaqAI** - Derived from "Halaqa" (حلقة), meaning a religious gathering or study circle in Islamic tradition, this feature helps users process insights from Islamic talks/lectures, prompting them to document key learnings and develop actionable implementation plans. HalaqAI bridges the gap between passive listening and active implementation by encouraging users to extract meaningful insights from religious gatherings and transform them into practical actions.

* **MuhasabAI** - From "Muhasaba" (محاسبة), the Islamic concept of self-accountability and introspection, this feature provides a guided reflection space where users can share thoughts, receive follow-up questions, and gain deeper insights about their thought processes with action items for personal growth. MuhasabAI facilitates the essential spiritual practice of honest self-evaluation that has been emphasized since the early days of Islam.

* **WirdhAI** - Based on "Wird" (ورد), referring to daily devotional practices or regular spiritual routines in Islamic tradition, this feature offers a structured approach to creating realistic spiritual and personal growth goals with 30-day challenges and long-term habit tracking. WirdhAI uses identity-based frameworks for goal development and a proprietary CLEAR model for habit creation, helping users establish consistent spiritual practices that align with their faith.

* **Personalized Guidance** - AI responses tailored to user's knowledge level, interests, and life stage

* **Client-side Encryption** - Secure storage of user reflections and personal information

* **Progress Visualization** - Visual representations of habit completion and spiritual growth over time

## Technical Specifications
* **Technology Stack**: Large Language Models (Claude by Anthropic), client-side encryption, mobile/web frameworks [TBD]

* **Platform Support**: Mobile applications (iOS/Android) and web interface

* **Integration Capabilities**: Integration with notification systems for habit reminders

* **Security**: Client-side encryption ensuring user data privacy; only email and user ID accessible to administrators

* **Deployment Model**: Cloud-based application with client-side processing for sensitive data

## User Experience
The application features a low-friction, supportive interface designed to encourage regular reflection and goal tracking.

## Performance and Scalability
Sahab AI is built to handle personalized interactions with each user while maintaining response speed. The application can scale through infrastructure expansion and API key rotation to accommodate growing user bases while managing the 50 calls per minute limit from Anthropic.

## Support and Maintenance
The application is intended to be provided free to users, with maintenance costs covered through [TBD] funding model to support ongoing infrastructure and API token expenses.

## Current Status
The application is currently in development with core functionality being implemented.

## Additional Information
Sahab AI is firmly grounded in Islamic principles with strong prompt engineering to ensure outputs are authentic and undisputed. The application deliberately avoids controversial topics or providing fatwas (religious rulings), instead focusing on virtue, reflection, and personal growth.

The application employs several engagement strategies including:
* 30-day challenges for short-term goal achievement
* Visual progress tracking
* 2-3 day grace periods to maintain streaks if users miss logging
* Encouraging messages to help users stay motivated

A memory/learning component is being developed to create private user profiles that will allow the AI to reference past interactions and provide more personalized guidance over time.
